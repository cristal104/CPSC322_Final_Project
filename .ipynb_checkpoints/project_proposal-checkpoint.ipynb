    "* step - maps a unit of time in the real world. In this case 1 step is 1 hour of time. Total steps 744 (30 days simulation).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* type - CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT and TRANSFER.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* amount - amount of the transaction in local currency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* nameOrig - customer who started the transaction  \n",

    "* oldbalanceOrg - initial balance before the transaction  \n",

    "* isFraud - This is the transactions made by the fraudulent agents inside the simulation. In this specific dataset the fraudulent behavior of the agents aims to profit by taking control or customers accounts and try to empty the funds by transferring to another account and then cashing out of the system.  \n",

    "There test results are useful because we are using various factors to predict if a transaction is fraudelent. This is something that banks need in order to help a customer whose bank account has been targeted. It is also useful for banks as they are able to detect fraudelent activity and contact the customer to verify that the transaction was meant to happen. "
